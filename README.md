# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model
Built an end-to-end supervised classification model to predict Titanic passenger survival based on demographic and travel features. I have used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
